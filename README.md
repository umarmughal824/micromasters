# MicroMasters
Portal for learners and course teams to access MITx MicroMasters programs.

# Initial setup

MicroMasters mostly follows the same [initial setup steps outlined in the common ODL web app guide](https://github.com/mitodl/handbook/blob/master/common-web-app-guide.md).
Run through those steps in order with the following changes:

1. After [creating the database models](https://github.com/mitodl/handbook/blob/master/common-web-app-guide.md#3-create-database-tables-from-the-django-models), you should create the Elasticsearch indices via management command:

   ```
   docker-compose run web ./manage.py recreate_index
   ```

1. **Do not run the `createsuperuser` command.** When you log into this app via edX, a MicroMasters 
Django user is created for you automatically. See the section below for instructions on how to run edX locally.


### Running edX devstack locally _(optional, but recommended)_

MicroMasters can work with a deployed instance of edX, but it's recommended that
you get it running locally. It's obviously more configurable that way, and you'll
likely need to run it locally for other projects in the future.

#### 1) Install edX

Download and install the edX Docker containers according to [these instructions provided by 
edX](https://edx-installing-configuring-and-running.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/install_devstack.html)

#### 2) Connect to the VM and run the LMS server

edX has [instructions for this as well](https://edx-installing-configuring-and-running.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/devstack/start_devstack.html#connect-to-devstack-vm).
More concisely, these are the commands you should run to connect to the VM and run the LMS server:

    # In your local edx_devstack/ directory, checkout the master branch of devstack
    git checkout master
    # assuming you want to run the master branch of edX, check it out
    make dev.checkout
    # update devstack, just in case:
    make down
    make pull
    make dev.up

#### 3) Configure a user with superuser permissions

edX devstack ships with [several test 
users](https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OXA/pages/157751033/What+are+the+default+accounts+and+passwords) 
(there is also an `edx` user not listed in this wiki, already configured as a superuser). To keep things
simple, it is **highly** recommended that for your main MicroMasters login you use (a) the `edx` superuser, or (b) 
one of the other test users and manually set superuser permissions. Setting superuser permissions can be done
in Django admin or in a shell. It's preferable to do it in Django admin as you'll
need to use Django admin for the next step anyway.

- **In Django admin**

    Run the server (discussed in step 2) and navigate to Django admin
    (eg: http://localhost:18000/admin/). In the **Authentication and Authorization**
    section, select a **User**, or add one then select it. In the **Permissions**
    section, check the **Superuser status** box and save.

- **In a Python shell**

        # Kick off an interactive shell
        python manage.py lms --settings=devstack shell

        ### RUN THESE WITHIN THE SHELL ###
        from django.contrib.auth.models import User
        # Using 'staff' here, but this will work with any test user's username
        user = User.objects.get(username='staff')
        user.is_superuser=True
        user.save()

#### 4) Add an OAuth client

Open Django admin (see "In Django admin" in the previous step),
login as the user you chose in the previous step,
navigate to the Django OAuth Toolkit section (http://localhost:18000/admin/oauth2_provider/),
and add a new Application. Fill in the values as follows:

- **User**: Use the lookup (magnifying glass) to find your superuser from the previous step.
- **Redirect uris**: The URL where MicroMaster’s will be running, followed by "/complete/edxorg/". 
  `http://localhost:8079/complete/edxorg/` should work for Linux and OSX users
- **Client type**: Set to '_Confidential_'.
- **Authorization grant type**: Set to '_Authorization Code_'.
- **Name**: Anything you want. Something like 'mm-local' would do fine here.
- **Skip authorization**: Check this box to mimic the UX in production.

#### 5) Copy relevant values to use in the MicroMasters .env file

The MicroMasters codebase contains a ``.env.example`` file which will be used as
a template to create your ``.env`` file. For MicroMasters to work, it needs 4 values:

- ``EDXORG_BASE_URL``

    The base URL where the LMS server is running on your machine. 
    **Linux Users** use ``http://localhost:18000``, 
    **OSX Users** The MicroMasters container won't be able to reach the LMS container without a name. Use 
    ``http://edx.devstack.lms:18000`` and make sure `edx.devstack.lms` is configured to point to 127.0.0.1 in your
   `/etc/hosts` file.  The LMS server runs on port ``18000`` by default.
    
- ``EDXORG_CLIENT_ID`` and ``EDXORG_CLIENT_SECRET``

    These values can be found in the Django OAuth Toolkit Application you created above.
    **Client id:** and **Client secret:** values should be auto-generated for
    that new Application. Use those values for the corresponding ``EDXORG_``
    variables in the ``.env`` file.

#### 6) [OSX] Connect the MicroMasters web container to the edX devstack network

MicroMasters containers and edX docker devstack containers run on separate networks. We need MicroMasters to be able
to connect to the lms application to complete oauth authentication. Run the following command to add the MM web
container to the devstack network:

- ``docker network connect devstack_default micromasters_web_1``

Unless we can find a way to add this to docker-compose.yml, you'll have to run this command every time you 
start the MicroMasters containers. 

#### General edX devstack debugging notes

- To update your devstack with important changes from edX, run `make dev.provision` in
your edx_devstack directory. This will pull down the latest release and run migrations, among
other things.
- If you get an error related to Mongo locking, run the following in the lms container

       function mongo_unlock {
           sudo rm /edx/var/mongo/mongodb/mongod.lock
           sudo mongod -repair --config /etc/mongod.conf
           sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /edx/var/mongo/.
           sudo /etc/init.d/mongod start
       }
       mongo_unlock
- If you get the error  _"Unknown task: devstack, the working directory has not been updated
properly"_, simply run ``cd /edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform`` and re-run the command.


# Additional setup

### Configure `.env` settings

The following settings should be configured before running the app:

- `EDXORG_BASE_URL`, `EDXORG_CLIENT_ID` and `EDXORG_CLIENT_SECRET`

    If you're running edX locally as detailed in the steps above, you've already done this. If you're running
    against a deployed edX instance, `EDXORG_BASE_URL` should be the base URL of that instance, and you'll need to get
    the client id/secret values from devops.

- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`

    You should get your own API key from Google and use it here. [Learn how to
    get an API key from Google.](https://github.com/mitodl/micromasters/blob/master/docs/google-api-key.md)


# Running and Accessing the App

MicroMasters follows the same steps outlined in the [common ODL web app guide for running and accessing the app](https://github.com/mitodl/handbook/blob/master/common-web-app-guide.md#running-and-accessing-the-app).

After completing those steps, you should be able to do the following:

1. Visit MicroMasters in your browser on port `8079`.
2. Click "Sign in with edX.org" and sign in by authorizing an edX client. If you're
 running edX locally and you're not already logged in, use the same user that you configured above.
 
### Configuration after first login

**It's highly recommended that you do the following immediately after your first login with an edX user.** 
After logging into MicroMasters via edX with a given user for the first time, a new MicroMasters user is created to mirror that edX user.
These commands will help you to fully explore the MicroMasters UI:

1. **Set your user as a superuser.**

    ```python
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User
    # Replace 'staff' with the username of the edX user you logged in with
    user = User.objects.get(username='staff')
    user.is_superuser = True
    user.is_staff = True
    user.save()
    ```

2. **Seed the database with example programs, courses, users, etc.**

   This will create programs and courses, and a set of users with enrollments and grades in those courses. This helps to flesh out
   both the learner and instructor UX for the app.
   
   ```bash
   # Run from a shell in your host machine
   # Replace 'staff' with the username of the edX user you logged in with
   docker-compose run web ./manage.py seed_db --staff-user='staff'
   ```

After completing those two steps, reload MicroMasters in the browser and complete the profile for your user. You should be able to select a program for enrollment, and after completing the forms you should be able to access both the instructor and learner views (`/learners` and `/dashboard` respectively).

### Wagtail CMS (Content Management System)

The CMS can be found at `/cms/`. Use the CMS to manage the content of the program pages and home page.  

#### Adding a new MicroMasters program

1. Login to the CMS with an admin account. If you don't have one, you can use the superuser account created earlier.

2. Click on the `Explorer` menu in the left nav to find the home page (labelled "MIT credentials are...")

3. Click on `+ Add Child Page`

4. Choose Program Page. Complete the form. Don't forget to publish your changes.

#### Adding CMS users

1. Don't create new users from the CMS. Ask users to log in and fill out a MicroMasters profile first.  

2. Login to the CMS with an existing account. If you don't have one, you can use the superuser account created earlier.

3. From the Settings menu in the left nav, choose users.

4. You can use the search box to locate users who already exist. If the user already exists, click on the username and 
skip to step 5.

5. Click on the Roles tab. 

6. Check the box for the editors group. This will allow the user to view and edit all pages in the CMS. 

# Testing

See the ['Testing' section of the common web app guide](https://github.com/mitodl/handbook/blob/master/common-web-app-guide.md#testing) for most of the commands for running tests, linting, etc.

There are also some MicroMasters-specific testing tools:

    # [Linux] Run JS type-checking
    docker-compose run watch npm run flow
    # [OSX] Run JS type-checking
    npm run-script flow

Note that running [`flow`](https://flowtype.org) may not work properly if your
host machine isn't running Linux. If you are using a Mac, you'll need to run
`flow` on your host machine, like this:

    yarn install --frozen-lockfile
    npm run-script flow
    
### Selenium

To run selenium tests make sure you have the application running, including the web
server and webpack dev server. Then run this script to run the selenium tests:

    ./scripts/test/run_selenium_tests_dev.sh

This script sets up certain environment variables and runs
all tests in the `selenium_tests/` directory, which are assumed
to all require selenium.

**Note**: If you are having trouble with database state
(this works differently from the rest of the tests), remove the
`--reuse-db` flag from `pytest.ini` and try again.

If a test errors but selenium is still working, it will take
a screenshot of the browser at the point of the error and write it
as a png file in the project directory.

##### Viewing running tests in the browser

Selenium tests run locally will forward port 7000 to the inner container. To
view the test server with your browser, go to `http://<your_mm_ip_address>:7000`.


# Running Commands

#### Setting user state

You'll often need a user to be in a certain state with respect to some course/course run (e.g.: your user needs to have
a passing grade in some course). There is a management command that can be used to easily accomplish this kind of change 
of state.

	# See usage details
    docker-compose run web ./manage.py alter_data --help
    # See example commands
    docker-compose run web ./manage.py alter_data examples

#### Generating screenshots

There is a helper script that uses Selenium to create screenshots of various learner dashboard states.
To generate these screenshots, run this command:

    ./scripts/test/run_snapshot_dashboard_states.sh

Screenshots are saved to the `output` directory.

#### Validating financial aid info

To validate prices and financial aid discounts for all programs run:

    docker-compose run web ./manage.py validate_db


# Connecting to external services

#### Elasticsearch

If you want to connect to an ES cluster aside from the one created by Docker, you'll need to do the following:

1. Add these variables to your `.env` file (without parentheses):

        ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX=(your_index_name)
        ELASTICSEARCH_URL=https://(your_elastic_search_url)
        ELASTICSEARCH_HTTP_AUTH=(your_cluster_name):(key)

2. If any of the above variables are set in the `web` configuration in `docker-compose.yml`, those
 will override the values you have in `.env`. Delete them.
3. Restart the `db` and `elastic` docker-compose services if they're running:
 `docker-compose restart db elastic`
 
You should now be able to connect to the external ES cluster. You
can run `docker-compose run web ./manage.py recreate_index` to test
that it's working.
